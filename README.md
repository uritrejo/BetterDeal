# BetterDeal
Repository for Capstone Project

# Overview
The objective of the software to be built is capturing data of products posted online (to be more specific, cars of certain specs)  and performing price comparison over time.
The project consists of three main components:
1) Data Extraction Tool
2) User Interface
3) Notifications

# Objective
The main problem that looks to be solved is the redundancy of tasks such as continuously refreshing a webpage manually in order to find new postings. 


# Impact
Our project is intended to automate a task that is usually done manually in the automotive industry. This is the business that would ideally be benefited.
